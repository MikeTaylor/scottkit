How the "continue" action works.  By inspection of Adventureland,
there is only one instance of it there:

	action DRO WAT when carried bottle and at room1 {
	  print "Sizzle..."
	  continue
	  swap bottle bottle1
	}

	occur when here FIRESTONE {
	  swap now FIRESTONE
	}

This is illuminating.  First, continue doesn't have to be the last
instruction in an action: so it doesn't mean "proceed with the next
action", it means "note that when you're done with this action that
you may continue to the next".  Second, note that the second action
has a condition which must be met, so the continue also doesn't mean
"actually do the next action", but "evaluate whether the next action
should be done".  (That's why the continue is used here: the second
set of instructions should be executed only if the second condition is
true as well as the first.)  The probability associated with follow-on
actions is ignored, though (and is probably always zero, to prevent
those actions firing in other circumstances).

Because conditions are still checked for actions reached by continue,
we can not fold actions linked by continue into a single long action
with multiple instructions, as tempting as that sounds.

More: it's apparent from Voodoo Castle that a continue action means
not just to attempt the next action, but ALL subsequent actions that
have verb and noun both equal to zero.  Here is the decompilation of
the code for examining the Count:

	action LOO COF when here Coffin1
		print "A sign here says:"
		print "Count Cristo's been CURSED! [...]"
		continue
		print "There's a man here"

	occur 0% when !exists foot
		print "He's wearing a rabbit's foot"

	occur 0% when !exists ring
		print "Wearing a sapphire ring"

At the start of the game, the rabbit's foot exists (elsewhere) and the
ring does not, so the first occur does not fire but the second does.
