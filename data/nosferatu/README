This is a re-implementation of my 1982 game _Nosferatu_:
http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/tech/advent/nos/

It was originally written in lovingly hand-crafted BASIC for the
VIC-20 with 8k expansion, and marketed by Terminal Software.

To play the VIC-20 original in an emulator:
$ xvic -memory 8k -autostart ~/web/new/comp/tech/advent/nos/NOSFERAT.TAP

Known bugs:
* "wait" always summons bus.
* "climb ladder" always works as a teleport
* The end of the game has not been coded
