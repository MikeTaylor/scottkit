This is a re-implementation of my 1982 game _Nosferatu_:
http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/tech/advent/nos/

It was originally written in lovingly hand-crafted BASIC for the
VIC-20 with 8k expansion, and marketed by Terminal Software.

Known bugs:
* "wait" always summons bus.
* "climb ladder" always works as a teleport
* The end of the game has not been coded
