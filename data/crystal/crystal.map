Can hold breath for four moves:
	GO POOL
	GO INFLOW
	DROP VASE
	GO VASE (at river2)
		(BREATHE; HOLD BREATH)
	LEAVE VASE
	S
	S
	S
And if you don't do the vase-breathing trick, it gets you:
	GO POOL
	GO INFLOW
	S
	S
as far as river3, which is where we need to see the first glow of light

Another underwater-movement puzzle:

	Pool1		Pool2
	 \		 \
	  (^Up, vDown)	  (^Up, vDown)
	 /		 /
	Bottom1---------Bottom2

You can only swim down from Pool<n> to Bottom<n> while carrying a
brick as ballast, but then you can only swim back up if you're NOT
carrying it.  That's fine for going through once in one direction, but
you can't get back.  The trick is to tie a rope to the brick, swim
down, go east or west as necessary, drop the brick and swim up while
still carrying the rope.  Then when you're out of the pool, you can
pull the rope to bring the brick back up.

"The stoat was broken into five pieces. We were going to scatter them
across the kingdom, but we never go around to it, so they're all in
this cupboard."
