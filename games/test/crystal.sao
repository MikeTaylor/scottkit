"Your task is to find the six crown jewels of the"
"kingdom and store them in this hut.  They are:"
"a platinum chain, a gold crown, a silver medallion"
"a bronze sceptre, a zinc goblet and a tin stoat."
"Oh, there they are.  That wasn't as hard as I expected."
"Ah, looks like I'm still missing the stoat."
"I have to breathe NOW!"
"I can only hold my breath for"
"more turns."
"I can't breathe ..."
"The plywood also catches fire and burns quickly."
"The oak catches, and becomes a roaring fire."
"Smoke pours upwards."
"I can't chop anything without an axe."
"I don't have a battering ram."
"I don't have anything to light it with."
"It says - `Leave *TREASURES* here, then say: SCORE`"
"No!  Bees would sting me!"
"Smoke 'em out!"
"TIMBER!"
"There's nothing there all right! Maybe I should forget it?"
"It's locked."
"It splinters easily."
"There's a tunnel beyond."
"CRUNCH!  It's smashed to smithereens!"
"DOOSH!  It's absolutely annihilated!"
"It's also locked."
"Ouch!"
"CRUNCH!"
"There's a passage beyond."
"OF COURSE it's locked!"
"It's too solid for the axe to make much impression."
"DOOSH!"
"There's an entrance beyond."
"Not while I'm carrying it!"
"I can't get it to catch fire."
"My match goes out."
"There's no way it will catch fire."
"OK.  It burns up very quickly."
"Bear won't let me"
"Bear eats the honey and falls asleep."
"It's bigger than I am."
"I'm already holding my breath!"
"OK"
"Which door?  Use `knock iron` or `knock bronze`."
"Nothing happens."
"Nothing seems to happen."
"You'll have to figure it out for yourself."
"It looks like a pretty average"
